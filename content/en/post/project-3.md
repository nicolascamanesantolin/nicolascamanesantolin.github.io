title: "Project 3: Project Estimator and OpeanAI API Investigation"
---

This project was carried out during my internship at the company Mas Ingenieros, while I was studying Computational Mathematics at the Jaime I University. The main objectives of this internship were the completion of two projects. The first involved researching and documenting the OpenAI API, and the second focused on creating a project estimator for internal use within the company.

The investigation and documentation of the OpenAI API began by thoroughly reading all available documentation on the OpenAI website regarding the functionality of their API. Special attention was given to the operation of tokens and the four models available at that time: Ada, Babbage, Curie, and Davinci. Subsequently, using PostMan, tests were conducted on the functionality of the different models. Thirdly, research was conducted on the fine-tuning process of the different models. Finally, documentation was carried out on the data preparation tool for the models, along with training and testing of the different models to estimate both training and testing costs for each model, as each model had different complexities and, therefore, different costs.

The creation of a project estimator involved studying the possibility of, based on a database designed for this purpose, creating a predictor that could predict the cost, departments involved, experienced leaders in that type of project, and the time to complete the project based on the similarities of measurable variables for a project before it is undertaken.
