title: "Project 5: Exploratory data analysis"
---

This is the project carried out for the Exploratory Data Analysis course in the Data Science master's program at the University of Valencia.

In this Exploratory Data Analysis project, a real dataset is explored to obtain valuable insights and conclusions. The dataset used for analysis belongs to the National Institute of Statistics (INE). Specifically, it is from a survey conducted on the population in the year 2021 with the purpose of providing detailed information about individuals, households, and buildings that cannot be obtained through administrative records. In this case, the exploration mainly focused on the part related to questions posed to adults (individuals aged 16 and older). To add more variables of interest, some were selected from another dataset, also from this survey, which was conducted on all household members and not just adults.

The analysis begins by examining the general characteristics of the dataset. Secondly, missing data analysis is performed. Once it is ensured that the data is in the data.frame structure, has correctly labeled values, and is stored with the correct type, as well as understanding the origin of the missing values, we can start looking for possible patterns in instances or among features. This is done in an attempt to answer a series of questions posed at the beginning of the project through brainstorming.

In the process of answering the questions, different types of analyses are conducted, including Univariate Analysis, Univariate Outlier Analysis, Multivariate Analysis, Multivariate Outlier Detection, Clustering with Numeric Attributes, and Clustering with Categorical and Numeric Variables.

All the procedures carried out are documented in the project report.
