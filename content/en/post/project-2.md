title: "Project 2: MemWrist"

This project was carried out as part of the Entrepreneurship course during my study period in the Computational Mathematics degree at Jaime I University. The main objective was to collaboratively develop a business plan with the rest of the team, centered around the idea of a product. Throughout the project, essential stages were undertaken, including product development, market analysis, competitor analysis, and the formulation of the business and financing model.

In essence, the product conceived in the project aimed to improve the quality of life for individuals suffering from Alzheimer's, as well as their caregivers. Additionally, it aimed to provide information to advance the development of medications targeting such diseases. The product consisted of an activity bracelet, through which information about the user's condition (heart rate, oxygen levels, stress, sleep hours, and daily tasks such as eating, medication intake, or movements within the home) could be obtained. The device facilitated communication within families, providing basic and essential information about the user's condition. More importantly, the collected data were analyzed to generate objective information, forming a report that assists specialists in their diagnosis. Beyond this, the solution sought to address the physical and psychological strain on families by offering an assistance kit that provides recommendations from professionals in the sector to alleviate the effects of caregiver syndrome. Finally, all collected data were analyzed and uploaded to a shared cloud accessible to pharmaceutical companies, which could use the data for their own research. This solution is directed towards aiding both family members and medical professionals, with constant attention to the elderly users who wear the device.
