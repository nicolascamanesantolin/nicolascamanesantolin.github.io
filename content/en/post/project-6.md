title: "Project 6: Signal Analysis"
---

This is the project carried out for the Signal Analysis subject in the Master's in Data Science at the University of Valencia.

Through the completion of this project, the goal was to conduct research on the characteristics that can be extracted from musical audio signals and compare possible differences between different musical genres. The extraction of different features was done in Python using the Librosa library. This library is designed to facilitate the extraction of features from audio signals, as well as their manipulation and analysis.

The work is divided into two different phases. Firstly, an explanation of the theoretical foundations necessary for understanding the different features that can be extracted from an audio signal, along with the possible influence of the genre on these values. Secondly, the process of extracting some of the explained features for a set of songs with different musical genres, generating a dataframe to conclude the project by applying machine learning techniques such as principal component analysis or unsupervised classification algorithms (clustering).

The set of songs available consists of five different musical genres: Jazz, Opera, Rap, Reggae, and Rock. Each genre has 20 different songs, totaling 100 songs. The created dataset, the notebooks with graphics generated for the explanation of theoretical foundations, and the notebook with Python implementations corresponding to this project are available in the GitHub repository.
