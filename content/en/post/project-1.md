title: "Project 1: Instagram Scraper"
---
This project was carried out as part of the Computer Security course during my Computational Mathematics degree at the Jaime I University. The main objective of the project was to create an information extractor capable of gathering data from different profiles, as well as downloading posts.

The project methodology involved the development of a Python program. By using the Selenium Webdriver, Time, Os, Wget, and Warnings libraries, various functions were implemented to work in synergy. These functions, given an Instagram username as input, enabled the collection of profile information, retrieval of addresses for each post, and ultimately, the download of all posts from the account.
