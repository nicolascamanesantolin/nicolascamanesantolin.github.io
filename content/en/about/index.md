Since I completed my basic studies in high school, I have discovered my true passion for mathematics. It was this revelation that led me to choose the Computational Mathematics degree at the University Jaime I. Throughout my time at university, I explored various branches and applications of mathematics by engaging in different projects and assignments.

However, it wasn't until the period in which I combined my internship experience at Mas Ingenieros with the completion of my undergraduate thesis that I had a transformative encounter with my true professional motivation: Data Science. It was at this juncture that I decided to enhance my knowledge and skills by pursuing a master's degree in Data Science at the University of Valencia. This step not only solidified my interest in the field but also provided me with a robust foundation to delve deeper into the fascinating world of data analytics and interpretation.
